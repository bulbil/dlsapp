Bagby-Rogers-Wood-Fishback family papers,scanning,UK - Special Collections,non-project,2,boxes,1,739,"The Babgy-Rogers-Wood-Fishback family papers consist of correspondence and financial papers of the John and Matilda Bagby family and their children and children-in-law (Wood, Rogers, and Fishback families).  The extended family was originally from Barren County, Kentucky, in the communities of Blue Spring Grove (Goosehorn or Hiseville), Rich Grove (south of later Goodnight), and Coral Hill.  Various family members moved west to Missouri, Illinois, California, and Texas during the mid-nineteenth century, and the majority of the letters in this collection document that movement.  The writers alternately express their joy in and their dislike of their new surroundings and encourage their Barren County relatives to send them news of the rest of the family.  The writers' health concerns, social lives, religious participation, political opinions, financial and farm dealings, and wartime observations take place within the context of being immigrants in newly-created western states.

Specific topics in the letters include on-the-scene accounts from the Christian perspective of events leading up to the lynching of Joseph Smith and other Mormon leaders in Illinois in 1844; personal observations on, attitudes about, and effects of the Civil War on a slave-owning family which lost three of its sons to the conflict; comments on Abraham Lincoln, Henry Clay, and Andrew Jackson; criticism of the mail; and detailed accounts of a trip to California and a Southern migrant's reflections on the diverse ethnic makeup of the state, gender roles, and geography.
